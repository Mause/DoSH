DoSH
====

This is an attempt at an extensible shell framework for the DCPU16 platform.
It is intended to be compiled under the [DCPUToolchain](http://github.com/DCPUTeam/DCPUToolchain).


#### Build Instructions;
First of all, you require a copy of the DCPUToolchain; binaries can be downloaded from [the official website](http://DCPUToolcha.in)
Once you have extracted the files somewhere, you must edit the DCPUTOOLCHAIN variable in the ```CMakeLists.txt``` file to point to the location of the binaries/whereever you extracted the contents of the tarball.



#### TODO;
