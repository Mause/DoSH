DoSH
====

This is an attempt at an extensible shell framework for the DCPU16 platform.
It is intended to be compiled under the [DCPUToolchain](http://github.com/DCPUTeam/DCPUToolchain).


#### Build Instructions;
You first require a copy of the DCPUToolchain; binaries can be downloaded from [here](http://DCPUToolcha.in)
Once you have extracted the files somewhere, you edit the DCPUTOOLCHAIN variable in the CMakeLists.txt <!-- it might be worth writing a config script to set this automatically :P--> to point to the location of the binaries/wherever you extracted the contents of the tar-ball.



#### TODO;
Refer to issues
