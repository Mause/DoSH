DoSH
====

This is an attempt at an extensible shell framework for the DCPU16 platform.
It is intended to be compiled under the [DCPUToolchain](http://github.com/DCPUTeam/DCPUToolchain).

HINT: to compile, compile the dosh.c file. Everything else is included into that one file

// TODO: add build script :smile:
